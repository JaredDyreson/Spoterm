    <h2>funnel cake</h2>
    <p>This program is aimed to help combine multiple Spotify Playlists into a larger one.</p>
    <p>Funnel Cake needs access to the following to work correctly</p>
    <ol>
    	<li>playlist-modify-public</li>
	<li>user-library-read</li>
	<li>user-library-modify</li>
	<li>user-read-email</li>
	<li>user-read-private</li>
    </ol>
   <p>Reasons why these permissions are needed, please read the documentation <a href="#">here</a> for full transparency</p>
    <h2>usage</h2>
    <ol>
    	<li>Click authenticate in the top left hand corner</li>
	<li>Give funnel cake the proper permissions</li>
	<li>Plug in two playlist urls you wish to merge</li>
	<li>Give the merged playlist a name and click the button labeled "Merge"</li>
	<li>Profit</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>credit</h2>
    <p>This project would not have gotten off the ground if it we're for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH">this</a> YouTube playlist. It outlined the basic structure of a Flask application along with proper jinja2 syntax for dynamic HTML pages.</p>
    <p>Another big thanks to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26726165/python-spotify-oauth-flow">this</a> Flask application to authenticate Spotify users. I would not have been able to continue this project without it and has served to be very reliable</p>
